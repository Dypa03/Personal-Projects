            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Hi Nintendo enjoyers I'm Dypa, just a classic web developer that creates pages to practice skills,
                 pretending taht there is someone that reads these pages ;D
                <br> Today I'm going to share with you my top 3 games for Nintendo Switch in 2023 before Tears of the Kingdom is out
                (I'm really excited for it and it will be my birthday present) </p>

            <p><span class="bold">Disclaimers!</span>
            <ol>
                <li>These are personal opinions, if you don't agree it's fine, it just means your opinions are wrong;</li>
                <li>I'm not rich so I didn't play many of them so I missed some really good games like Xenoblade Chronicles for example;</li>
                <li>This top 3 includes also cross-platform(that are also avaible for other consoles) games like Dragonball Xenoverse 2.</li>
            </ol>

                alt="metroid dread">
                <p>I borrowed this game from a friend(together with Legends: Arceus which is trash to me) and I just finished recently and OMG if it's sooooo good.
                    <br>
                    <br>Metroid Dread is a fantastic addition to the Metroid franchise, offering an intense and thrilling gameplay experience that is both challenging and rewarding. 
                    <br>The game's graphics are stunning, with vibrant colors and detailed environments that truly immerse the player in the world of Samus. 
                    The controls are smooth and responsive, making it easy to navigate through the game's many obstacles and enemies. 
                    <br>But what really captured me are the bosses which are really frustating but really rewarding, and the cutscenes which aren't many but they are so good(I've watched them like 20 times).
                    <br>
                    <br>Overall, Metroid Dread is a must-play for fans of the series and anyone looking for an exciting action-adventure game 
                    <br>I forgot to mantion that this is my first Metroid game and you don't have any idea on how much I would like to play Metroid Prime Remastered rn thanks to this masterpiece.
                    <br>
                    <br>Now let's move on to next one that is one of the best games ever existed and a true revolution to modern gaming which is...

                <h2>2. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h2>

                alt="Zelda: Breath Of The Wild">
                <p>Yeah yeah I know what your are thinking: "WHAT!?!?! ZELDA ONLY NUMBER TWO!?!?!"
                    <br>In an objective tier list and in a Nintendo exclusives' top Zelda would be the number one by far, BUT the next game that arrived on Switch some months ago really <span class="italic">took over me</span>(this is a quote to a song of the game).
                    <br>But now let's just talk about this awesome game even if I don't need to explain why it is so good.
                    <br>
                    <br>Zelda Breath of the Wild is a masterpiece that redefines open-world gaming. The game's vast and immersive world is filled with countless secrets, surprises, and challenges that keep you engaged and eager to explore. 
                    <br>The gameplay is dynamic and allows for endless creativity, as you can approach objectives in a variety of ways. The game's art style is breathtaking, with beautiful landscapes and stunning attention to detail.
                    <br>
                    <br>Overall, Zelda Breath of the Wild is a must-play for any gamer, and a true testament to the power of great game design, especially in the open-world field(where Zelda gets its spot as the best game by far).
                    <br>
                    <br>Now for the first place you will never guess it, or better, <span class="italic"> "You will never see it coming"</span>...

                <h2>1. Persona 5 Royal</h2>
                <img

                alt="">
                <p>Sorry if I repeat the word "masterpiece" but I don't know how else I could describe this amazing game that really changed my mind.
                    <br>This game is literally Pokemon with JoJo, and if you are a Pokemon fan you must play this game(since the Pokemon games on Switch are so bad lmao, especially the last two).
                    <br>
                    <br>Persona 5 Royal is an incredible RPG that blends engaging storytelling, deep character development, and addictive gameplay into a truly unforgettable experience. 
                    <br>The game's stylish and unique visuals, catchy and awesome soundtracks(that I still listen today after 5 months), and unique combat system all contribute to its immersive atmosphere. 
                    <br>The new content in Persona 5 Royal(which includes Italian subtitles to help my country), including the additional characters and storylines, add even more depth to an already rich narrative.
                    <br>
                    <br>This game truly changed my life cause I've really saw some of my problems in this game and it helped me in the jorney of finding myself.
                    <br>Overall, Persona 5 Royal is a must-play for fans of the series and newcomers alike, and one of the best RPGs available on any platform, and it is by far my favorite game of all times.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>So these was my top 3 Nintendo Switch games hope you enjoyed and let me know if you agree or you would have put something else.
                <br>Also if I have to be really honest I didn't complitely wrote the reviews by myself, I actually asked ChatGPT to make these reviews for me and I changed them I little bit adding personal thoughts.
                <br>I'm made this for 3 main reasons:
                    <ol>
                        <li>This is a test for coding, so the content should be irrelevant since this is never going to see the light</li>
                        <li>I'm not an true expert Gamer, I'm just a casual player that shared his opinions</li>
                        <li>I'm kinda lazy and didn't want to spend to many hours into this practice project :D</li>
                    </ol> 
                <br>That's all I had to say. 
                <br>
                <br>See ya,
                <br>Dypa
